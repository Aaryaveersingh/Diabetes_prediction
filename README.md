# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health parameters using machine learning models.

## Overview

The Jupyter Notebook analyzes a dataset containing medical details such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and other health indicators to predict diabetes risk.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (recommended: 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aaryaveersingh/Diabetes_prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Diabetes_prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `Diabetes_prediction_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess data, visualize trends, train models, and evaluate performance.
3. Adjust model parameters if needed and re-run training to improve predictions.

## Files Included

- `Diabetes_prediction_project.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook file.
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python packages.
- `Diabetes_dataset.csv` - CSV file containing the dataset.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## Results

- Data visualization of key health indicators affecting diabetes risk.
- Implementation of machine learning models like support vector machine.
- Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
